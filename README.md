## FAQ ‚ùì
**Q: Why and for what did you make this project?**
- **A**: This project was created for High Seas, and I've truly enjoyed every second of it. The inspiration struck when I was experimenting with an image editor on my phone, and I thought, "Why not make my own?" So, Reyal was born! 

**Q: Where did the name Reyal come from?**
- **A**: The name "Reyal" is simply the word "Layer" spelled backwards, symbolizing the layer effects in the editor

**Q: When I draw, my cursor has some offset. How do I fix that?**
- **A**: To fix the cursor offset, try reducing the zoom to 80% or less, or use a smaller picture. This should help align your cursor with the canvas.
